# Data Analyst Job Market Analysis

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created to better navigate and understand the job market. It delves into top-paying and in-demand skills to help identify optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data is sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python), which provides a foundation for this analysis. It includes detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

## Research Questions

This project aims to answer the following questions:

1. What are the most in-demand skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying) 

## Tools and Technologies

For an in-depth analysis of the data analyst job market, I used several key tools:

- **Python:** The core of my analysis, enabling data processing and insights. Key Python libraries used include:
    - **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
    - **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
    - **Seaborn:** For creating advanced visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** To run Python scripts, include notes, and present analysis effectively.
- **Visual Studio Code:** For developing and executing Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** For version control and sharing the code and analysis, facilitating collaboration and project tracking.

## Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare and clean the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.
